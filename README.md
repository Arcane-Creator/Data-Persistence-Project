Break the Bricks

Break the bricks, when all have been broken, a new wave will spawn.
The further up the brick is, the more points it is worth.
Check your status on the Leaderboard, which saves between plays.

This was my Data Persistence Project with Unity's Data Persistence tutorial.
Hope you enjoy it!
